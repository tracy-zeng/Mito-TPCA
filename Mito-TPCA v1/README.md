# Mito-TPCA
## About
This repository is used for the Mito-TPCA project to compare Mito-TPCA with conventional TPCA and to detect dynamic changes in mitochondrial protein-protein interactions (PPIs)/protein complexes during ferroptosis and cuproptosis. We have used the data archiving tool Zenodo to archive this repository and issued a DOI for the archive: 10.5281/zenodo.15487921.

This repository was constructed by ZENG Ya & WANG Jun.
